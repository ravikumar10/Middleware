# Middleware
Middleware is the software that connects software components or enterprise applications. It is the software layer that lies between the operating system and the applications on each side of a distributed computer network. Typically, it supports complex, distributed business software applications.

Here i have implemented this part in GoLang.

I have created a Mux(router ) and added routes ti it.

and then added function to out middleware.
